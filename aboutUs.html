        <p id="us">Pear Caravel games was founded by accident in 2018 by gaming partners and brothers Sean and Colin Wilson as a result of a maliciously persistent anagram. The company creates and distributes fan expansions for existing games and is developing its first major title for publication, Mage Gunz. Our games are for one specific nautilus named 'Lenny' deep in the inky darkness of the frigid south Pacific, and everyone else. The name is a play on C.S. Lewis's 'Cair Paravel' that lead to an image Sean has never been able to get out of his head since age 11: our logo.</p>

            <b>Lead Game Designer.</b> Sean has been studying, experimenting with, dismantling and adding to tabletop and video games of all descriptions since about 1990. He has a passion for games which emphasize discovering novel paths to victory and experimenting with the system. Sean's cat is named "Throgmorton," his favorite tabletop game is Scythe (but ask him tomorrow) and his ideal superpower is not having this headache anymore.

            <b>Head Playtester.</b> Scott is an engine of destruction which no game can withstand. He once crashed the digital implementation of Ascension so badly with an infinite combo that it uninstalled. Scott wins at Pear Caravel game night, like, a lot. Like, really a lot. Scott once played in a ball pit and won at THAT. Scott's cat is named "Gustav," his favorite tabletop game is Terraforming Mars and as of this writing we're not sure what his ideal superpower is but we do know his favorite hero is the Flash.
